Here are some suggestions for definitions that may help to clarify the terminology:

- **Meta-analysis:** A general term to denote the collection of statistical methods and techniques used to aggregate/synthesize and compare the results from several related studies in a systematic manner.
- **Moderator analysis:** In the context of a meta-analysis, this refers to using some kind of method in an attempt to find and account for systematic differences in the size of the effect or outcome that is being meta-analyzed.
- **Meta-regression:** *This is one possible way of conducting a moderator analysis, where we regress the observed effect sizes on one or multiple study characteristics.*

There are other ways of conducting a moderator analysis. For example, one could simply *subgroup studies* based on a categorical moderator (using dummy variables in a meta-regression model is quite similar). Not commonly used, but one could also consider mixture models or clustering techniques.
